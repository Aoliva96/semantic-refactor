## Collaborators

I collaborated with Keegan Royal-Eisenberg, George Shultz, and Joshua Jacob in a study-group on 12/12/2023, in which we compared and suggested code snippets and semantic best practices. 
I utilized suggestions made by Keegan R.E. to make the following changes to my HTML:
- Change my sidebar < section > to an < aside > tag.
- Assign a role of "navigation" to my nav tag.
- Assign a title to my "background-img" section to enhance site accessibility. 

I also shared the following code snippit with the other members of the 12/12/2023 study group:
- "pointer-events: none;" added to "background-img" id in CSS.
- This solves the issue of unintentional rollover text being displayed to the user, due to the "background-img" section having a "title" attribute.
